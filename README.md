# DenseNet-Based Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Classification and Interpretation through Grad-CAM

**Tools & Technologies:** Google Colab · Machine Learning · Deep Learning · DenseNet · Image Processing · Grad-CAM

## Project Overview

This project implements a deep learning approach for the classification of **Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)** using microscopic blood smear images. The model is built on the **DenseNet** architecture and enhanced with **Grad-CAM** to provide visual interpretability by highlighting influential regions in the input images.

##  Key Features

-  **DenseNet-Based Model**  
  Implemented a deep convolutional neural network using the DenseNet architecture to classify images into **ALL** and **HEM** (healthy) categories.

- **Grad-CAM for Model Interpretability**  
  Utilized **Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM)** to visualize the critical regions of each image that influenced the classification results.

- **Image Preprocessing & Evaluation**  
  Applied preprocessing techniques and performance evaluation to improve accuracy and ensure model reliability.

-  **Medical Relevance**  
  Provides interpretable AI-based assistance for early leukemia detection, supporting clinical decision-making.

## 📊 Outcome

The combination of accurate classification and visual explanation supports effective and trustworthy computer-aided diagnosis in hematology.
